This is a Token Authentication Middleware for Slim 4.0+.  
This middleware was designed to maintain easy to implement token authentication with custom authenticator.  

Slim Token Authentication [1.x version](https://github.com/dyorg/slim-token-authentication/tree/1.x) requires PHP 7.1 ou newer.  
For oldest PHP version you can use [0.x version](https://github.com/dyorg/slim-token-authentication/tree/0.x).

## Installing

Get the latest version with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org "Composer").

```bash
composer require dyorg/slim-token-authentication "^1.0"
```

## Getting authentication

Start by creating an `authenticator` function, this function will make the token validation of your application.
When you create a new instance of `TokenAuthentication` you must pass an array with configuration options. 
You need setting authenticator and path options for authentication to start working.

```php
$authenticator = function(ServerRequestInterface &$request, TokenSearch $tokenSearch) {

    /**
     * Try search authorization token via header, parameters, cookie or attribute
     * If token not found, return response with status 401 (unauthorized)
     */
    $token = $tokenSearch->getToken($request);

    /**
     * Call authentication logic class
     */
    $auth = new AuthService();

    /**
     * Verify if token is valid on database
     * If token isn't valid, must throw an UnauthorizedExceptionInterface
     */
    $user = $auth->getUserByToken($token);

    /**
     * Set authenticated user at attibutes (optional)
     */
    $request = $request->withAttribute('authenticated_user', $user);

};

$app = new App();

$app->add(new TokenAuthentication([
    'path' => '/api',
    'authenticator' => $authenticator
]));
```

### Getting Token

Inside your authenticator clousure, do you can call `getToken` through `TokenSearch` object. 
This method is able to search for authentication token on header, parameter, cookie or attribute.
You can configure it through options settings.

## Configuration Options

### Path

By default no route requires authentication. 
You must set one or more routes to be restricted by authentication, setting it on `path` option.
 
```php
...

$app = new App();

$app->add(new TokenAuthentication([
    'path' => '/api', /* or ['/api', '/docs'] */
    'authenticator' => $authenticator
]));
```

### Except

You can configure which routes do not require authentication, setting it on `except` option.

```php
...

$app = new App();

$app->add(new TokenAuthentication([
    'path' => '/api',
    'except' => '/api/auth', /* or ['/api/auth', '/api/test'] */
    'authenticator' => $authenticator
]));
```

### Header

By default middleware tries to search token from `Authorization` header. You can change header name using `header` option.
Is expected in Authorization header the value format as `Bearer <token>`, it is matched using a regular expression. 
If you want to work without token type or with other token type, like `Basic <token>`, 
you can change the regular expression pattern setting it on `regex` option.
You can disabled authentication via header by setting `header` option as null.

```php
...

$app->add(new TokenAuthentication([
    'path' => '/api',
    'authenticator' => $authenticator,
    'header' => 'Token-Authorization-X',
    'regex' => '/Basic\s+(.*)$/i', /* for without token type can use /\s+(.*)$/i */
]));
```

### Cookie

If token is not found into headers, middleware tries to find `authorization` cookie. 
You can change cookie name using `cookie` option. 
You can disabled authentication via cookie by setting `cookie` option as null.

```php
...

$app->add(new TokenAuthentication([
    'path' => '/api',
    'authenticator' => $authenticator,
    'cookie' => 'token'
]));
```

### Parameter

As a last resort, middleware tries to find `authorization` query parameter. 
You can change parameter name using `parameter` option. 
You can disable authentication via parameter by setting `parameter` option as null.

Be Careful! User tokens shouldn't be send by parameters in production environment, it's represent a potential security risk. Prefer use header or cookie options. 

```php
...

$app->add(new TokenAuthentication([
    'path' => '/api',
    'authenticator' => $authenticator,
    'parameter' => 'token'
]));
```

### Attribute

When token is found, it's storage into `authorization_token` attribute of ` ServerRequestInterface : $request` object. This behavior enables you to recovery the token posterioly on your application.

```bash 
$token = $request->getAttribute('authorization_token');
```

You can change attribute name using `attribute` option. 
You can disabled the storing of token on the attributes by setting `attribute` option to null.

```php
...

$app->add(new TokenAuthentication([
    'path' => '/api',
    'authenticator' => $authenticator,
    'attribute' => 'token'
]));
```


### Error

By default on ocurred a fail on authentication, is sent a response on json format with a message (`Invalid Token` or `Not found Token`) and with the token (if found), with status `401 Unauthorized`.
You can customize it by setting a callable function on `error` option.

```php
...

$error = function(ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response, UnauthorizedExceptionInterface $exception) {
    
    $output = [
        'message' => $exception->getMessage(),
        'token' => $request->getAttribute('authorization_token'),
        'success' => false
    ];
    
    $response->getBody()->write(json_encode($output));
    return $response
        ->withHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')
        ->withStatus(401);
    
}

$app = new App();

$app->add(new TokenAuthentication([
    'path' => '/api',
    'authenticator' => $authenticator
    'error' => $error
]));
```

This error function is called when `TokenAuthentication` catches a throwable class that implements `UnauthorizedExceptionInterface`, or when your authenticator method returns `false`.

### Secure

Tokens are essentially passwords. You should treat them as such and you should always use HTTPS. 
If the middleware detects insecure usage over HTTP it will return unathorized with a message `Required HTTPS for token authentication`. 
This rule is relaxed for requests on localhost. To allow insecure usage you must enable it manually by setting `secure` to false.

```php
...

$app = new App();

$app->add(new TokenAuthentication([
    'path' => '/api',
    'authenticator' => $authenticator,
    'secure' => false
]));
```

Alternatively you can list your development host to have `relaxed` security.

```php
...

$app->add(new TokenAuthentication([
    'path' => '/api',
    'authenticator' => $authenticator,
    'secure' => true,
    'relaxed' => ['localhost', 'my-application.local']
]));
```
